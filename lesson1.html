    <h2>World Wide Web Summary</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web (WWW) is a collection of documents that use <b>Hypertext Markup Language </b>(HTML).
      Webpages are connected by <b>hyperlinks</b> (links).
    Files can be found on the web include <em>HTML, plain text, images, videos,</em> and <em>music.</em>
    </p>
    <p>A web browser on a computer (such as Internet Explorer) sends a request to servers through the Internet,
      using <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</b> (HTTP),
    and the servers respond by sending files that can be viewed or played by the browser.</p>

    <h2>HTML</h2>
      <h3>Basic Components</h3>
      <p>HTML is made up of:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Text content</li>
        <li>Markup (formatting of the content)</li>
        <li>References to other documents, such as images</li>
        <li>Links to other pages</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
      <h3>Tags</h3>
      <p>HTML markup uses tags, which are typically structured as <b>&lt;tagname&gt;content&lt;/tagname&gt;</b>.
        The first tag is called an "opening tag,"
      the second tag (with the slash) is called a "closing tag." The entire structure is called an element.
      </p>
      <!-- I used information from http://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_punctuation.asp for displaying the angle brackets. -->
      <p>Examples of tags with this structure are &lt;b&gt;<b>bold</b>&lt;/b&gt; and
        &lt;em&gt;<em>emphasis (italic)</em>&lt;/em&gt;
      </p>
      <p>Tags can also have <b>attributes</b>, which equal some kind of value. The structure of a tag with an attribute is
      <b>&lt;tagname attribute="value"&gt;content&lt;/tagname&gt;</b>
      An example of a tag with an attribute is the <b>anchor tag</b> &lt;a&gt;,
      which is used to create links. A tag like this one<br>
      &lt;a href="http://www.ledorestaurant.com/"&gt;Pizza for lunch!&lt;/a&gt;
      would display like this in the browser:<br>
      <a href="http://www.ledorestaurant.com/">Pizza for lunch!</a>
      </p>
      <p>An <b>image tag</b> is an example of a <b>void tag</b>, in which the tag contains no content,
        and thus does not need a closing tag.
      An image tag also contains two attributes: src, whose value is the link to the image,
      and alt, whose value is text that describes the image for
      <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/web/section-508">Section 508 compliance</a>.
      This tag &lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Copo_de_nieve.png" alt="snowflake"&gt;
      would display like this:<br>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Copo_de_nieve.png" alt="snowflake" height="50" width="50">
      </p>
      <!-- I shrunk the image to make it fit better on the page -->
      <p>There are a number of tags that can group and format content:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>&lt;br&gt; break</li>
          <li>&lt;p&gt; paragraph</li>
          <li>&lt;span&gt; span</li>
          <li>&lt;div&gt; div</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These tags all contain content, and therefore use closing tags.
        &lt;br&gt; and &lt;span&gt; are <b>inline</b> tags,
        meaning their formatting is done within a line. &lt;p&gt; and &lt;div&gt; are <b>block</b> tags,
        meaning that they form a block, or box of content.
        &lt;span&gt; and &lt;div&gt; can also control the style of their content.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
      <h3>Document Structure</h3>
      <p>A basic HTML document has these components:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Doctype &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</li>
          <li>HTML tags at the beginning and the end of the document</li>
          <li>Head tags, which includes relevant metadata, CSS, and Javascript functions</li>
          <li>Body tags, which contain the content of the document</li>
        </ul>
      <p>This class will mostly focus on the body of the document.</p>
