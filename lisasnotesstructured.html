    <h1>Lesson 1: Getting Started with HTML</h1>
    <div class="content">
    <h2>World Wide Web Summary</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web (WWW) is a collection of documents that use <b>Hypertext Markup Language </b>(HTML).
      Webpages are connected by <b>hyperlinks</b> (links).
    Files can be found on the web include <em>HTML, plain text, images, videos,</em> and <em>music.</em>
    </p>
    <p>A web browser on a computer (such as Internet Explorer) sends a request to servers through the Internet,
      using <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</b> (HTTP),
    and the servers respond by sending files that can be viewed or played by the browser.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
    <h2>HTML</h2>
      <h3>Basic Components</h3>
      <p>HTML is made up of:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Text content</li>
        <li>Markup (formatting of the content)</li>
        <li>References to other documents, such as images</li>
        <li>Links to other pages</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
      <h3>Tags</h3>
      <p>HTML markup uses tags, which are typically structured as <b>&lt;tagname&gt;content&lt;/tagname&gt;</b>.
        The first tag is called an "opening tag,"
      the second tag (with the slash) is called a "closing tag." The entire structure is called an element.
      </p>
      <!-- I used information from http://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_punctuation.asp for displaying the angle brackets. -->
      <p>Examples of tags with this structure are &lt;b&gt;<b>bold</b>&lt;/b&gt; and
        &lt;em&gt;<em>emphasis (italic)</em>&lt;/em&gt;
      </p>
      <p>Tags can also have <b>attributes</b>, which equal some kind of value. The structure of a tag with an attribute is
      <b>&lt;tagname attribute="value"&gt;content&lt;/tagname&gt;</b>
      An example of a tag with an attribute is the <b>anchor tag</b> &lt;a&gt;,
      which is used to create links. A tag like this one<br>
      &lt;a href="http://www.ledorestaurant.com/"&gt;Pizza for lunch!&lt;/a&gt;
      would display like this in the browser:<br>
      <a href="http://www.ledorestaurant.com/">Pizza for lunch!</a>
      </p>
      <p>An <b>image tag</b> is an example of a <b>void tag</b>, in which the tag contains no content,
        and thus does not need a closing tag.
      An image tag also contains two attributes: src, whose value is the link to the image,
      and alt, whose value is text that describes the image for
      <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/web/section-508">Section 508 compliance</a>.
      This tag &lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Copo_de_nieve.png" alt="snowflake"&gt;
      would display like this:<br>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Copo_de_nieve.png" alt="snowflake" height="50" width="50">
      </p>
      <!-- I shrunk the image to make it fit better on the page -->
      <p>There are a number of tags that can group and format content:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>&lt;br&gt; break</li>
          <li>&lt;p&gt; paragraph</li>
          <li>&lt;span&gt; span</li>
          <li>&lt;div&gt; div</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These tags all contain content, and therefore use closing tags.
        &lt;br&gt; and &lt;span&gt; are <b>inline</b> tags,
        meaning their formatting is done within a line. &lt;p&gt; and &lt;div&gt; are <b>block</b> tags,
        meaning that they form a block, or box of content.
        &lt;span&gt; and &lt;div&gt; can also control the style of their content.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
      <h3>Document Structure</h3>
      <p>A basic HTML document has these components:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Doctype &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</li>
          <li>HTML tags at the beginning and the end of the document</li>
          <li>Head tags, which includes relevant metadata, CSS, and Javascript functions</li>
          <li>Body tags, which contain the content of the document</li>
        </ul>
      <p>This class will mostly focus on the body of the document.</p>
      </div>
      <h1>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <h2>General Page Structure</h2>
        <p>A web page generally has a "tree-like structure," or hierarchy. 
        A &lt;div&gt;, for example, can have within it &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;p&gt; tags,
        which in turn can have text and tags within them. This is also called a <b>Document Object Model</b> (DOM).
        </p>
        <p>HTML is the language that controls the structure of the webpage. 
        CSS is the language that controls the visual style of the page.
        Different parts of the page, such as images, text, and headers, can be placed on the pages like boxes.
        Putting things in boxes (by using the &lt;div&gt; tag), is the first step towards controlling the 
        style of a page.
        </p>
      </div>
        <h1>Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style and HTML Structure</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <h2>CSS Styling</h2>
        <p>A typical CSS syntax looks like this: <b>selector {property: value;}</b><br>
          A <b>selector</b> can be an HTML element, or a particular chosen part of the document, called a <b>class</b>.
          A class name will have a dot in front of it, like this: .classname<br>
          The part of the syntax in the curly braces is called a <b>declaration</b>. It has a <b>property</b>, which is
          a particular style attribute, such as a color or a size, and a <b>value</b> for that attribute.
        </p>
         There are three ways to add CSS styling to an HTML page:<br>
         <ol>
           <li>Write CSS code in the head element of HTML. The element &lt;style&gt; is used.</li>
           <li>Link to a separate CSS file. Within the head element of the HTML is a link to the file,
           which will have this structure: <b>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="sheetname.css"&gt;</b></li>
           <li>Write CSS inline within the HTML document within the &lt;div&gt; tags. This is not advised because it would result 
           in repetitive coding, which could potentially cause problems when editing, and is generally a waste of time.</li>
         </ol> 
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <h2>Box Sizing and Positioning</h2>
        <p>
          HTML elements are boxes with 4 components: margin, border, padding, and content. To better control the sizing
          of a box, use percentages instead of pixels, and use <b>box-sizing: border-box</b>. You can also specify properties
          for specific browsers by using the prefixes -moz (Firefox), -ms (Internet Explorer), or -webkit (other browsers).
        </p>
        <p>
          &lt;div&gt; is a block element, which by default, takes up the whole width of a page. Using
          <b>display: flex;</b> allows &lt;div&gt; elements to display side by side.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <h2>Code, Test, Refine</h2>
          Generally, create a page based on a design as follows:
          <ol>
            <li>Look for natural boxes (groupings)</li>
            <li>Look for repeated styles and semantic elements</li>
            <li>Write the HTML</li>
            <li>Apply CSS styles</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the page looks like the design</li>
          </ol>
      </div>
  </body>
