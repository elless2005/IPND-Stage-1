        <h2>General Page Structure</h2>
        <p>A web page generally has a "tree-like structure," or hierarchy. 
        A &lt;div&gt;, for example, can have within it &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;p&gt; tags,
        which in turn can have text and tags within them. This is also called a <b>Document Object Model</b> (DOM).
        </p>
        <p>HTML is the language that controls the structure of the webpage. 
        CSS is the language that controls the visual style of the page.
        Different parts of the page, such as images, text, and headers, can be placed on the pages like boxes.
        Putting things in boxes (by using the &lt;div&gt; tag), is the first step towards controlling the 
        style of a page.
